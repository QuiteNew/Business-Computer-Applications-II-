Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple virtual instances of computing resources—such as servers, storage devices, or networks—to run on a single physical hardware system. By abstracting these resources, virtualization enhances efficiency, flexibility, and scalability in IT environments. It enables organizations to optimize hardware usage, simplify management, and reduce costs, as well as facilitate workload migration, disaster recovery, and testing of new applications without impacting the main infrastructure. Overall, virtualization plays a crucial role in modern computing, supporting cloud services and improving resource allocation.

Cloud computing is a transformative technology that enables users to access and store data and applications over the internet rather than relying on local servers or personal computers. By utilizing remote servers housed in data centers, cloud computing provides scalable resources and flexible services that can be quickly deployed to meet varying demands. This paradigm shift allows businesses and individuals to harness powerful computing resources, enhance collaboration, and reduce IT costs while ensuring data accessibility and security. With a variety of service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), cloud computing has revolutionized the way we manage and utilize technology in our daily lives and operations.
