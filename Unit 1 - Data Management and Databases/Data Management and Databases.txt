This unit introduces the fundamental concepts of databases and database management systems (DBMS). It lays the groundwork for understanding how data is organized, stored, and accessed in modern applications. Databases are organized collections of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system, allowing for easy access, management, and updating. A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that facilitates the creation, manipulation, and administration of databases, providing users with a systematic way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. DBMSs enable various functionalities such as data security, backup and recovery, concurrent user access, and data integrity. They can be classified into several types, including relational, NoSQL, and object-oriented databases, each designed to meet different needs and use cases. Overall, databases and DBMSs play a crucial role in supporting data-driven applications and decision-making processes across various industries.
