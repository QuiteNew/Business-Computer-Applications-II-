E-commerce and digital marketing have revolutionized the way businesses connect with consumers in the digital age. With the rise of online shopping platforms and social media, companies can now reach a global audience, offering products and services at the click of a button. E-commerce encompasses a wide range of online transactions, from retail sales to subscription services, while digital marketing utilizes various online strategies—such as search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, and email campaigns—to enhance brand visibility and engage customers. Together, these two domains not only facilitate seamless shopping experiences but also empower businesses to analyze consumer behavior, tailor their offerings, and drive growth in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
